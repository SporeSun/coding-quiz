## Description

I was motivated to create this quiz to practice my javascript knowledge and integrate it fully. I built it to further embed the knowledge in me and to create a useful, expandable tool to gain more knowledge. It solves my lack of knowledge and tools in javascript. I learned much: how to effectively make and stop a timer, how to effectively run through questions and enact penalties to score, and much more.

## Installation

N/A. Runs in broswer

## Usage

Start the quiz. Finish before the timer runs out. Every wrong answer deducts 10 seconds off the timer. Final score is remaining time.
